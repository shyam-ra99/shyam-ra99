# Welcome to my GitHub!

👋🏽 My name is Shyam Ravichandran and I'm a recent Master’s graduate in Bioinformatics from the University of Maryland.

🧬 I am passionate about applying bioinformatics to biopharma and translational research, with a focus on genomic data analysis, NGS, and computational pipelines that support drug discovery and development.

🚀 I’m currently pursuing roles in computational biology, with a strong interest in data analysis and applied machine learning in the life sciences. My current focus is strengthening my foundation in Python, SQL, Linux, and genomic data analysis, while continuing to build and refine hands-on projects that bridge Biology and Software Engineering.
